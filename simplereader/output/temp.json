Using an uniform distribution\nof \nCa2+ channels, we determined the minimal number of low threshold voltage-activated\ncalcium \nchannels and their permeability required for the onset of LTS in response to a hyperpolarizing\n\ncurrent pulse. In the 3-compartment model, we found that the channel distribution\ninfl uences \nthe fi ring pattern only in the range of 3% below the threshold value of total T-channel\ndensity. \nIn the multi-compartmental model, the LTS could be generated by only 64% of unequally\n\ndistributed T-channels compared to the minimal number of equally distributed T-channels.\nFor a \ngiven channel density and injected current, the tonic fi ring frequency was found\nto be inversely \nproportional to the size of the cell. However, when the Ca2+ channel density was\nelevated in \nsoma or proximal dendrites, then the amplitude of LTS response and burst spike frequencies\n\nwere determined by the ratio of total to threshold number of T-channels in the cell\nfor a specifi c \ngeometry.\nKeywords: thalamocortical cell, low-threshold spike, T-current, channel distribution\n dendritic tree. A multi-compartment model is required to consider \nthe effects of dendritic currents. A fi rst step in this regard was car-\nried out by Destexhe et al. (1998) who studied relay cell models with \na dendritic tree, which incorporated dendritic T-current densities. \nIn that work, a comparison of T-current density recorded from \nacutely dissociated and relatively intact cells suggested a higher \nT-current density in the dendrites compared to the soma. In addi-\ntion, the high distal T-current density predicted in that model led to \na number of speculations (Zhan et al., 2000) on relay cell responses \nto synaptic inputs arriving to distal dendrites. Fluorescent imaging \nstudy (Zhou et al., 1997) and patch clamp recordings from soma \nand proximal dendrites (Williams and Stuart, 2000) suggested a \nhigher density of T-channels on proximal dendrites. However, a \nhigh density of T-channels in distal dendrites was not required to \nreproduce low-threshold spikes in a model (Rhodes and Llinas, \n2005). Previously, both, experimental and modeling studies were \nnot effi cient in detecting the presence and the amplitude (value) of \nT-current in distal dendrites. Thus, the distribution of T-channels \nin the membrane of TC neurons remains to be elucidated.\nSince the active property of the dendrites affects synaptic integra-\ntion and response of the neuron (De Schutter and Bower, 1994a,b; \nGoldberg et al., 2007; Koch, 1999; Mainen and Sejnowski, 1996), in \nthe present study the pattern of T-channel distribution was inves-\ntigated in computational experiments. Given the experimental \nfact that T-channels are distributed unevenly over the TC neuron \nmembrane, we examined different forms of non-uniform distri-\nbution in the multi-compartment model in order to fi nd  possible \neffects of channel distribution on the cell response. We started \nINTRODUCTION\nThalamocortical (TC) neurons at depolarized membrane potential \nfi re in tonic mode, while when released from a hyperpolarizing \nstate and crossing the potential between −65 and −70 mV they \ngenerate low-threshold spikes (LTS), accompanied by sodium \nspikes (Jahnsen and Llinás, 1984a). During slow-wave sleep, TC \nneurons are hyperpolarized and fi re preferentially LTS accompa-\nnied by high-frequency spike-bursts, while during paradoxical \nsleep and likely other activated brain states they fi re mainly in the \ntonic mode (Hirsch et al., 1983; Steriade et al., 1993). Spike-burst \nelicited during slow-wave sleep precedes and follows a period of at \nleast 100 ms of silence, lasts 5–20 ms and usually consists of three \nto fi ve action potentials (Domich et al., 1986). Extracellular unit \nrecordings demonstrated also the presence of high frequency spike-\ntrains during waking states (Bezdudnaya et al., 2006; Sherman and \nGuillery, 2002). Both high frequency spike-trains at depolarized \npotentials and low-threshold spike-bursts elicited by synaptic vol-\nleys can have similar shape despite different underlying mechanisms \n(Rosanova and Timofeev, 2005). The low-threshold calcium current \n(I\nT\n) underlies burst generation in TC relay cells and plays a central \nrole in the generation of synchronized sleep oscillations (Destexhe \nand Sejnowski, 2001; Steriade and Deschénes, 1984; Steriade et al., \n1993, 1997; Timofeev et al., 2001).\nAscending and descending inputs to thalamic relay cells arrive \nat different compartments of the dendritic tree (Jones, 1985) and \ntheir integration depends on a large set of intrinsic currents.

Model of thalamocortical neuron\nwith 3- compartment model and then we extended the model to \n1267 compartments with a realistic morphology of the TC cell. \nWe hypothesize that the low-threshold response of a TC neuron \ncan be correctly reproduced in a multi- compartment model with \nan appropriate distribution of T-channel density. Moreover, we \nhypothesize that the specifi c form of channel distribution should \nhave physiological benefi ts for the cell. Here we show that the \nnumber of T-channels in the cell has a prime infl uence on LTS \nbursting and that the shape of the distribution becomes important \nonly in a specifi c range of the total number of T- channels. Since \ndifferent types of TC cells have different geometrical parameters, \nwe also investigated the infl uence of the cell geometry on the fi r-\ning pattern.\nMATERIALS AND METHODS\nMODEL\nThe electrophysiological response of a thalamocortical cell can \nbe modeled by a set of coupled differential equations with an \n appropriate set of parameters (McMullen and Ly, 1988; Rose and \nHindmarsh, 1985) based on experiments by Jahnsen and Llinás \n(1984a,b). In our simulation, we also used the Hodgkin–Huxley \nmodel for the TC cell. In order to reproduce the low- threshold \nresponse of the TC neuron, the kinetics of the T-current was \ntaken from voltage clamp experiments (McCormick and \nHuguenard, 1992).\nThe main feature of the electrophysiological response of a TC \ncell can be reproduced already from a single-compartment model \ninvolving Na\n+\n, K\n+\n and T-currents in the framework of Hodgkin–\nHuxley equations. Figure 1 shows the tonic response and the \nburst spiking of the modeled TC neuron. Above we proposed the \nhypothesis that all features of rebound spike-burst behavior can \nbe reproduced in a multi-compartment model, if one takes into \naccount the channel distribution in dendrites. The 3-compartment \nmodel simulations of TC neuron responses shown in this article \nhave been carried out using the NEURON simulating environment \n(Hines and Carnevale, 1997).\n3-COMPARTMENT MODEL\nThe ultimate goal of our study is to understand how the T-channel \ndistribution infl uences the electrophysiological response of real \nTC neurons. The fi rst steps of the study, however, were carried out \nusing the 3-compartment model, which allows to test parameters \nwith high computational effi ciency. Those compartments represent \nthe somatic segment and the dendritic arbor composed of proxi-\nmal and distal segments. According to a previous study (Destexhe \net al., 1998), the 3-compartment model allows with good precision \nto reproduce major electrophysiological features of TC cells. In \nour simulations, the basic (“control”) parameters of the three sec-\ntions are the following: length (l) and diameters (d): l\ns\n \u003d 38.41 μm, \nd\ns\n \u003d 26 μm for soma, lp \u003d 12.49 μm, dp \u003d 10.28 μm for proximal \nsection and l\nd\n \u003d 84.67 μm, dd \u003d 8.5 μm for distal section (Figure 2). \nWe have made the assumption that passive parameters of the cell \n(e.g. leak conductance, cytoplasmic resistance, and capacitance) \nare held constant in each compartment. The passive response of \nFigure 1 | Simulated rebound burst in TC cell from a single-compartment \nmodel.

The parameters were taken from the 3-compartment \nmodel by Destexhe et al.

This value represents the permeability \nof a patch of 1 cm\n2\n of membrane. Therefore, the total permeability \nof the section is obtained by integration over the entire surface. On \nthe other hand, the total permeability of a section is the product \nof permeability of a single channel and total number of channels. \nThus holds\nN\n P\n P A A\ntotal\n Ca\n Ca\n d\u003d\n ∫\n1\n1( )\n ( )\n  \n(6)\nHere N\ntotal\n, P\nCa\n( )1\n  and A denote the total number of T-channels, \nthe permeability of a single channel and surface of compartment, \nrespectively. For a given section area, increasing the number of \nchannels is equivalent to increasing the permeability of the section. \nIn the following we will refer to the permeability of channels in \nan area of 1 cm\n2\n of the membrane simply as channel permeability. \nIn the section “Calcium Channel Distribution”, we consider the \ninfl uence of the number of channels and its distribution on the \nburst response of TC cell. We also consider in the section “Multi-\nCompartment Model” the infl uence of geometrical parameters (e.g. \ndiameter, area) on the response of the cell.\nIn order to simplify calculations, we did not take into account \nthe h-current in the model, because this current does not contribute \ndirectly to the generation of LTS.\nMULTI-COMPARTMENT MODEL\nWe developed a multi-compartment model of the TC cell in order \nto consider the effects of dendritic currents upon response of the \ncell with realistic morphology. The simulations were performed \nbased on a TC cell reconstructed using the NeuroLucida dig-\nital system. In order to obtain precise morphological features of \nthe TC neuron from the VPL nucleus of thalamus, a retrograde \ntracer (fl uorogold) was iontophoretically applied to the somato-\nsensory area (SI) in adult anesthetized cat in sterile conditions. \nAfter a  survival period of 2 weeks the cat was deeply anesthetized \nwith thiopental and intracardialy perfused. Stained neurons were \nrevealed using a standard ABC kit. All experimental procedures \nused in this study were performed in accordance with the Canadian \nguidelines for animal care and were approved by the committee \nfor animal care of Laval University. The reconstructed cell used for \nthe model included 11 primary branches and 224 segments with a \ndendritic membrane area of 45 000 × 10\n−6\n m\n2\n. Our model contains \n1267 compartments, based on the d-lambda rule of NEURON. The \nsimulation of the multi-compartment model took approximately \n12 min on a Pentium(R) M with 2.00 GHz processor to run 800 ms \nof neuronal activity.\nRESULTS\nCALCIUM CHANNEL DISTRIBUTION\nIn the following simulations, we determined the minimum value \n(threshold) of the number of T-channels (N\nthr\n) and a corresponding \nvalue of permeability (P\nthr\n) in each section, which enables the gen-\neration of LTS in the TC cell. The threshold number of T-channels \nis defi ned here as the minimal number of T-channels required to \nproduce LTS in the 3-compartment model. This threshold value \ncorresponds to the onset of the fi rst sodium spike generated by LTS \nin response to a depolarized current of I\ninj\n \u003d 0.1 nA, while the cell \nis being hyperpolarized to V\nm\n \u003d −75 mV. However, if threshold LTS \nwas obtained under different conditions (e.g., different level of V\nm\n \nand/or different level of I\ninj\n) it did not affect the results presented \nin this study.\nRESULTS OF NUMERICAL SIMULATIONS\nIn the fi rst simulation, based on the 3-compartment model, the \ncalcium channel density was kept equal in each compartment, \nwhich means equal permeability for Ca\n2+\n ions in each compart-\nment (Figure 2A). According to experimental data from dissociated \ncells (Destexhe et al., 1998), the permeability in each compart-\nment was set to the value of P\nCa\n \u003d 1.7 × 10\n−5\n cm/s. Using this \nvalue in each compartment, the model gives a passive response \nto a depolarizing injected current (0.1 nA), at a hyperpolarized \nmembrane potential (−75 mV).

When the value of permeability at each compart-\nment reached P\nCa\n \u003d 1.56 × 10\n−4\n cm/s, the modeled cell reproduced \nthe fi rst LTS mediated action potential (Figure 2E). This perme-\nability was defi ned as the threshold permeability under conditions \nof V\nm\n \u003d −75 mV and I\ninj\n \u003d 0.1 nA. The threshold permeability cor-\nresponds to the threshold number of Ca\n2+\n channels (N\nthr\n) in the cell \nnecessary to generate the fi rst rebound spike in the model. The total \nnumber of T-channels in the cell is proportional to the product \nof compartment area and permeability of Ca\n2+\n channels in each \ncompartment. The membrane potential fl uctuates due to changes \nin channel permeability. Because the threshold value depends on \nthe level of membrane potential, we used a steady holding current \nto keep the membrane potential at −75 mV when we changed P\nCa\n. \nIn the case of an uniform T-channel distribution further increase \nin permeability produced LTS of larger amplitude leading to \nmultiple spike generation with increasing intra-burst fi ring fre-\nquency (Figures 2F–I). Because the experimental data suggest a \nnon- uniform T-channel distribution in TC neurons (Williams and \nStuart, 2000; Zhou et al., 1997), we examined different shapes of \nnon-uniform distribution of T-channels in the model leading to \nan LTS response.\n The total number of T-channels was kept constant and equal to N\nthr\n, \nwhich is the minimum number of T-channels necessary to generate an \nLTS response in a cell with uniform channel distribution. We explored \na variety of T-channel distributions that produced a fi rst LTS medi-\nated action potential in the model. Some examples of permeability \ndistribution and its corresponding channel number in each com-\npartment leading to an action potential are shown in Figure 3. Both, \nuniform and non-uniform distributions of T-channels can produce \nan LTS response with sodium spike in the model cell. This suggests \nthat when the total number of T-channels equals N\nthr\n then the shape \nof channel distribution does not affect the LTS response of the cell \n(Figure 4A). However, if the total number of channels was lowered the \nresponse of the cell depended on the shape of channel distribution. Far \nfrom the threshold value of the total number of T-channels any form \nof distribution gave a passive response, but when the total number \nof T-channels was close to threshold value, the response of the cell \ndepended on the form of channel distribution (Figures 4B–D).\nUsing small changes in the channel number in the 3- compartment \nmodel with non-uniform channel distribution, we found a small \nwindow in the total number of channels located below the defi ned \nthreshold of onset of LTS with spikes which was able to induce an \nLTS mediated action potential\nFigure 3 | Different shapes of Ca2+ channel distribution can generate \nLTS spiking.  Each line shows schematically the level of permeability \nin each compartment and its corresponding number of channels, \nwhich generate the threshold sodium spike similar to the response in \nFigure 2E.

We also tested extreme cases where the Ca\n2+\n per-\nmeability took the value 0 in two out of three compartments, and N\ntotal\n \nwas still 0.97 × N\nthr\n. These results led to the assumption that the mod-\neled cell can generate a rebound burst response for an optimal number \nof T-channels, which were distributed in a specifi c non-uniform pat-\ntern. We hypothesize that the physiological reason for the existence \nof such window on one hand may be related to reduced metabolic \nenergy consumption (see Discussion), and on the other hand to the \nability of the TC cell to generate a variable response pattern.\n EFFECT OF CELL GEOMETRY ON FIRING PATTERN\nFiring patterns do not only depend on the channel density and \ntype of current, but also on the geometry of the cell (length, \ndiameter, area, etc.) (Mainen and Sejnowski, 1996) as well as on \nthe cell topology (symmetry, mean path length, etc.) (van Ooyen \net al., 2002). Here we examined the infl uence of the cell geom-\netry on the fi ring pattern in the 3-compartment model of the \nTC neuron. For this purpose, we changed the diameter of each \ncompartment, while holding constant the diameter of other sec-\ntions, the channel densities, and the injected current. In addition, \nwe set the total number of channel equal to 0.98 × N\nthr\n where \nthe spiking induced by the LTS response of the cell is sensitive \nto the shape of distribution of the T-channels. Like in previous \nsimulations, the model includes the Na\n+\n/K\n+\n current in soma and \nthe T-current in soma, proximal and distal compartments. First, a \nFigure 4 | Total number of Ca2+ channels and its distribution determines \nwhether LTS will lead or not to an action potential. (A) When the total \nnumber of T-channels was equal to threshold value (Nthr\n), the model neuron \nproduced an LTS – action potential response with both, non-uniform and \nuniform channel distribution. (B) When the total number of channels was far \nfrom threshold value, the model gave LTS response not accompanied by \naction potentials. In this 3-compartment model, the response has \nno spikes as long as the total number of T-channels was below 0.97 × Nthr\n. \n(C) Between these two limits, the response of the neuron was sensitive to \nthe shape of the T-channel distribution. To illustrate this feature, we set the\n\ntotal number of channels equal to 0.98 × Nthr\n.

We \nkept constant the channel density for different cell geometries. The \nvariation of N\ntotal\n and N\nthr\n altered the response of the cell. With chan-\nnel density held constant, a decrease in the size of all compartments \nled to an increase in the input resistance, higher frequency of tonic \nfi ring and stronger LTS response (Figure 5B, I and V). Increasing the \nsize of the cell led to a decrease in input resistance of the cell, and as \nconsequence to lower excitability, expressed as a reduced fi ring fre-\nquency and absence of tonic or LTS response (Figure 5C, I and V).\nWe analyzed the effect of size of the section on the cell responses. A \nreduction in the size of an individual compartment (soma,  proximal \nor distal denrites) led to an increase in input resistance and frequency \nof tonic response (Figure 5B, II–IV). However, the LTS response to \na hyperpolarizing current injection was different. When the diam-\neter of soma changed to 1/3 of its initial value, the total number of \nT-channels reduced to 69% of threshold value, which was far from \nthe lower limit (97%) of total T-channels to generate a rebound \nburst response (Figure 5B, VI). When the diameter of proximal or \ndistal dendrite was decreased, then N\ntotal\n decreased. Despite this, \nsuch number was higher than the threshold (minimal) number of \nT-channels required to generate an LTS response. During rebound \nthe neuron fi red with large number of action potentials (Figure 5B, \nVII–VIII). Increasing the size of the cell reduced input resistance \nresulting in passive responses in  reaction to a depolarized or hyper-\npolarized current (Figure 5C, I and V). Smaller soma or dendritic \nsection reduced fi ring frequency and even prevented induction of \naction potentials during tonic or LTS response (Figure 5C, II–V, VII \nand VIII). Again, for a T-current distribution with higher density in \nproximal section, an LTS response for a bigger soma does not fol-\nlow the expected pattern. Increasing the somatic area reduced tonic \nFigure 5 | Infl uence of geometry on the response of cell with a higher \nT-channel density in proximal section. (A) In a control situation \n(Ntotal \u003d 0.98 × Nthr) the model TC cell generates six spikes in response to a \n0.2 nA depolarizing current pulse and one rebound spike in response to a \n−0.1 nA hyperpolarizing current pulse. (B,C; I–IV) Decreasing/increasing the cell\n\nsize increases/decreases input resistance of the cell. This causes higher/lower\n\nfrequency of tonic response to a depolarizing current. (B,C; V, VII, VIII). For\na \nconstant density of T-channels, reducing/increasing the size of the cell, or \nreducing/increasing the dendritic area increased/decreased input resistance as \nwell as Ntotal\n of the cell. This gives more/less sodium spikes induced by LTS. \n(B,C; VI) Despite the fact that smaller/larger soma has a higher/lower input \nresistance, the number of T-channels is also decreased/increased. Therefore, the\n\nsame hyperpolarized current pulse was found suffi cient/insuffi cient to activate\n\nenough T-channels for rebound burst response.\nFrontiers in Computational Neuroscience www.frontiersin.org December 2008 | Volume\n2 | Article 5 | 8\nZomorrodi et al.

This means that the same hyperpolarized current \ncan activate more T-channels which leads to a larger LTS response \nwith more action potentials (Figure 5C, VI). These numerical simu-\nlations based on a 3-compartment model of TC cell for the case of a \nhigher density of T-channel in proximal dendritic section show that \nsmaller distal dendrites and bigger soma are favorable to generate \nrebound bursts in the TC neuron.\nFurther, we investigated the effect of cell size on rebound \nspike generation when the density of T-current was higher in soma \n(Figure 6A) or distal dendrite (Figure 6B). When a higher density of \nT-channels was located in the somatic section, increasing/decreas-\ning somatic diameter increased/reduced the input  resistance of the \ncell. Hence, a higher/lower frequency in the response to a depolariz-\ning current pulse was obtained (not shown). When the total number \nof T-channels exceeded the threshold value in a larger cell, having \na lower input resistance, the injected hyperpolarizing current acti-\nvated a suffi cient number of T-channels to generate a rebound burst \n(Figure 6A, II and VI). Increasing size of both, the proximal and \ndistal dendritic section, did not shift the ratio of the number of \ntotal and threshold T-channels to a specifi c range which generates \nFigure 6 | Infl uence of geometry on the response of cell with a higher \nT-channel density in somatic or distal dendritic sections.

Model of thalamocortical neuron\na rebound burst response (Figure 6A, VII and VIII). Decreasing \nthe diameter of dendritic sections provided a higher than thresh-\nold value for T-channels which led to more sodium spikes during \nLTS response (Figure 6A, I, III and IV). When a higher density of \nT-channels was located in distal dendrites (Figure 6B), reducing the \nsize of the cell increased input resistance and N\ntotal\n, causing more \nsodium spikes during LTS (Figure 6B, I–IV). With increased cell \nsize and constant channel density, the rebound burst was found \nabsent (Figure 6B, V–VIII).\nMULTI-COMPARTMENT MODEL\nIn a multi-compartment model of the TC cell, reconstructed from \nfl uorogold retrograde staining (Figure 7, Ferecskó et al., 2007), we \ndistributed non-uniformly the T-channels throughout the cell. \nWe assumed a Gaussian distribution with specifi c mean value \nattributed to a high density of T-channels in the proximal, mid-\ndle, and distal dendrites. In addition, the width of the Gaussian \nfunction, defi ned by parameter σ was changed to study the effect \nof local channel density on LTS generation (Figure 8). Like in \nthe 3- compartment model we defi ned the minimum number of \nT-channels in the uniform distribution, as the number suffi cient to \ngenerate an LTS leading to a single spike in response to a depolar-\nized current of 0.1 nA, at hyperpolarized level of V\nm\n \u003d −75 mV. The \nnumerical simulation of an LTS response in which a non-uniform \nT-channel distribution was used shows that a smaller number of \nT-channels was suffi cient to generate an LTS response. In all simu-\nlations with non-uniform channels distribution, the LTS with a \nsingle spike was generated when N\ntotal\n \u003d 0.9 × N\nthr\n for σ \u003d 2, and it \nwas N\ntotal\n \u003d 0.8 × Nthr for σ \u003d 0.5 (Figure 8). However, when the \nlocal T-channel density on proximal dendrites was high (σ \u003d 0.5), \nthe LTS accompanied by action potential was generated with only \nN\ntotal\n \u003d 0.64 × N\nthr\n (Figure 8). Thus, our model predicts that a high \nlocal channel density on proximal dendrites favors LTS generation \nwith a minimal number of channels.\nDISCUSSION\nThe prime objective of this study was to investigate how different \npatterns of T-channel distributions infl uence the LTS response of a \nTC cell in a 3-compartment and a multi-compartment model. We \nalso investigated the infl uence of the cell size on the fi ring  pattern. \nThe major fi ndings of this study are: (1) An increase in the value \nof permeability (number of channels) uniformly in three com-\npartments changed the response of the TC cell from passive to \nLTS behavior being accompanied by an action potential. (2) The \nonset of fi ring does not only depend on the total permeability of \nT-channels, but also on their distribution. (3) In a 3-compartment \nmodel, with a channel number equal or above threshold the TC \ncell always responded by spiking. If a non-uniform distribution of \nchannels was used, a number of channels smaller than threshold \ncan lead to neuronal fi ring. (4) In a multi-compartmental model \na minimal number of channels required for the generation of LTS \nwith spikes was found to be much lower than in the 3- compartment \nmodel. (5) For a high density of T-channels in the soma and proxi-\nmal section, the frequency of tonic fi ring was inversely proportional \nto the diameter of the section, while the low threshold spiking \nfrequency was directly proportional to the diameter of the section. \n(6) The steepness of channel distribution (higher local density of \nchannels) lowers the required minimal number of T-channels nec-\nessary for LTS generation.\nPrevious modeling studies on the subject compared results \nobtained in dissociated cells with cells recorded from 200 μm thick \nslices (Destexhe et al., 1998). Dissociated cells contained almost no \ndendrites, while cell recorded from slices contained several trun-\ncated dendrites. As we show here, the dendritic arbor of TC cells \nextends for more than 400 μm (Figure 7). The study by Destexhe \net al. (1998) demonstrated the presence of signifi cant T-currents \nin the dendrites. It also demonstrated that the most robust features \nof LTS can be reproduced in a reduced 3-compartment model. In \nour numerical simulations, we took a 3-compartment model and \ndemonstrated that in such model the uniform vs. non-uniform \nchannel distribution can infl uence LTS generation in the range \n97–100% of channel number ratio (Figure 4). However, when we \nused a morphologically intact cell as basis of our model (Figure 7), \nthe shape of channel distribution played a major role. If the highest \ndensity of T-channels was located on proximal dendrites, the mini-\nmal number of T-channels able to generate an LTS-spike response \nwas only 64% of threshold value. Therefore, comparison of our data \nto the dissociated cells or cells recorded from slices (Destexhe et al., \n1998) provided solid differences, because most of distal dendrites \nare absent in the cells from slices.\nA general principle, which living organisms use to accomplish \nmany functions, is the principle of minimal resourses. The result \nof our study predicts that similar to sodium channels distribution \n(Crotty et al., 2006), the non-uniform distribution of T-channels, \ncould be essential for the generation of LTS using minimal resources. \nMost of proteins, including T-channels are synthesized in the cell \nbody and transported from there to its destination. Protein synthe-\nsis and transport requires energy. In addition, the metabolic energy \nconsumption is proportional to the ionic currents generated in \nFigure 7 | Morphology of reconstructed TC cell.

Model of thalamocortical neuron\nthe neuron via ATPpase Na\n+\n/K\n+\n or Ca\n2+\n/Na\n+\n metabolic exchangers \n(Dipolo and Beauge, 2006; Goldberg et al., 2003; Laughlin et al., \n1998; Lennie, 2003). Following LTS generation, the intracellular \nCa\n2+\n concentration increases, and reestablishing Ca\n2+\n concentration \ntakes additional energy. Thus, optimizing the number of channels \nwould optimize metabolic energy consumption. The closest place \nfor T-channels to be located in the plasma membrane is the cellular \nbody. However, most of inhibitory synapses are formed in the body \nof TC neurons (Liu et al., 1995a,b). Thus, the shunting created by \ninhibitory activities would prevent generation of LTS even with \nrelatively high density of T-channels. The next closest place being \nenergy effi cient for T-channels would be the proximal portion of \nthe dendritic tree. Indirect experimental measures (Williams and \nStuart, 2000; Zhou et al., 1997), congruent with the current study \nsuggested the presence of high density of T-channels on proximal \ndendrites of TC cells. Our parallel electron microscopy study using \nimmunogold staining of T-channel subunits in reticular thalamic \nnucleus demonstrated that in reticular nucleus cells, the T-channels \nare non-uniformly distributed (Kovács et al., 2007). The defi nite \nconclusion about the exact distribution of T-channels in the TC \ncytoplasmic membrane may be reached from high-resolution elec-\ntron microscopy experiments. Optimization of metabolic energy \nconsumption is a decisive factor for the ion channel distribu-\ntion (Crotty et al., 2006). Our results from the three- and multi-\n compartment model predict the existence of such window.\nEven if T-channels would be equally distributed over the cyto-\nplasmic membrane, the T-channels could be either in the phospho-\nrylated or de-phosphorylated state. Phosphorylation facilitates the \ngeneration of T-current at resting membrane potential (Leresche \net al., 2004). Thus, state dependent changes of the membrane poten-\ntial could create a non-uniform distribution of phosphorylated \nT-channels in different compartments of TC neurons and would \nfacilitate the generation of LTS.\nWe conclude that although different factors could be responsible \nfor a decrease in the availability of T-channels for LTS genera-\ntion (physical number of channels or ratio of phosphorylated/de-\nFigure 8 | T-channel distribution required for LTS generation with minimal \nnumber of channels in multi-compartment model.

Below examples are given for the response of the modeled \nneuron kept at −75 mV subject to 0.1 nA square current pulses. Note that the \nlower number of T-channels necessary to generate LTS occurred when the \nhighest channel density was located in proximal dendrites. In addition, a sharp\n\nT-channel distribution leads to LTS generation with fewer channels (bottom, right).\nFrontiers in Computational Neuroscience www.frontiersin.org December 2008 | Volume\n2 | Article 5 | 11\nZomorrodi et al.
