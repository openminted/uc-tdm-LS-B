== Introduction
LS-B is designed to aid the curation of neuroscience entities from the literature with the aim of supporting ongoing curation efforts in the Blue Brain Project (BBP), at the École
Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne (EPFL). At the first release of this application we have developed a web service built using the Argo text mining workflow system (http://argo.nactem.ac.uk/). 

Some technical information for the application can be found at: <<technicalInformation.adoc#, Technical Information>>

The web service is available at: http://nactem.ac.uk/api/openminted/neuroscience/ (please be noted that this is not a web page hence cannot be accessed via web browsers).
